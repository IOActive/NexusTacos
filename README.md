NexusTaco is a snmp scanner that can be used both for internal testing and external testing to assess Cisco Nexus switches ( 5000 and 6000 family).

There are many snmp scanners and brute forcers this was made for just completeness.It has the following features:

*Finds Nexus switches specifically since they seem to reply to bogus community strings

*Bruteforces Vlan ID’s which can be used for Vlan hopping / double tagging attacks without a community incase #3 doesn’t come through (useful for internal tests)

*Bruteforces snmp community strings To find the following: **System uptime **Configured networks (leverage more ground)

**Files and folders

**VTP secret and password ( can be cracked since its md5 and might be the telnet login password if exists or used somewhere else)

**Once a write community string is found the running configuration file will be send to your set ip in argv[2]. You need to configure a tftp server like solar winds’s one or something.

TODO:

*Still looking up sneaky OID’s that can provide usernames that are configured locally on the switch

*If found private snmp CS check if a AAA server is running (and get the shared secret wether radius or TACACS+)

*Show logged in users

*Disable snmp traps

*Check for port security if configured incase you need to spoof your mac so you don’t loose your port(internal tests).

*Use getopt …..

*Router reload over snmp just for evilness.

*Anything else I forgot.
